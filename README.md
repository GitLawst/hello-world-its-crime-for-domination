The 1,000 Mile Journey

I am now in my early 30's, with a spotted past, a troubled present, and uncertain future I am hoping to redefine myself into the man I feel is deep withihn my heart. I feel obligated in changing because I know what it is that is inside my heart and seeing as how we get one experiance at a time it is imperative to make the best out of our lifes. Particularly, we need to focuas on being a benefit in our families, neighborhoods, and communities. While attending college I developed a drug habit that was only sustainable through criminal acts. I lost amy heart, I lost my purpose, i lost myself. 

It's time to get it back and then some. This is not a comfort trip this is a pursuit of all things that make life uncomfortable and intimidating and meeting them head on. This is my awakening! Oh come now, that is enough. i babble  no more.....
